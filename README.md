I'm following the tutorial on the site. This is all new to me. I'm learning.

Hello, everybody!

I'm currently learning Python and Javascript. I signed up for a GitHub account mainly to follow other programmers that are more experienced than I am and study their code, so I can learn.

Right now I'm writing this as I follow the tutorial on how to use this site.
